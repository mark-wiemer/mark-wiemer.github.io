        <p>Hi, my name is Mark. I'm a math tutor at University of Wisconsin-Madison, and I wanted to create a site to better serve students struggling in math.</p>
        <p>This site offers supplemental learning material that I believe is difficult to find elsewhere. Primarily, I focus on abstract problem-solving methods that can be applied to families of problems. With the materials on my site, I aim to help students become unstuck while completing assignments. In this way, I hope to empower students and instill in them confidence in their abilities to tackle large, complex problems.</p>
        <p>Everything about this website is open source. For the techies out there, you can view the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/mark-wiemer/mark-wiemer.github.io">here</a>.</p>
        <p>If you find any issues, points of confusion, or weird behaviors with the website, please <a href="https://github.com/mark-wiemer/mark-wiemer.github.io/issues/new">contact me here</a> (a free GitHub account is required). I'm also open to any general feedback about the site through that link.</p>
