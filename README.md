# Math with Mark

A personal website to share math information and practice basic web development. View it live at https://mark-wiemer.github.io.

## Development

This website currently uses very few frameworks (see [Toolchain](#toolchain)), so development is pretty straightforward:

1. Clone the repo
1. Make and save your changes
1. Open [index.html](./index.html) in a local browser

## Toolchain

Hosted by GitHub Pages

Math displayed beautifully thanks to [MathJax](mathjax.org)
