# Math with Mark

A personal website to share math information and practice basic web development. View it live at [mathwithmark.com](https://mathwithmark.com).

## Development

This website currently uses very few frameworks (see [Toolchain](#toolchain)), so development is pretty straightforward:

1. Clone the repo
1. Make and save your changes
1. Open [index.html](./index.html) in a local browser

## Toolchain

Hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)

This website looks pretty because it uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

Math displayed beautifully thanks to [KaTeX](https://katex.org)
