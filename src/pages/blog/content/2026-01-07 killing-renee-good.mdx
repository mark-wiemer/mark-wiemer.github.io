postTitle: 2026-01-07 Killing of Renée Good and subsequent actions
---

Last updated 2026-01-14

These are early stage personal notes, highly subject to change.

None of this is legal advice.

## A note on terms

It's unclear to me whether Good's legal first name includes the diacritic (Renee vs Renée), but it seems [she preferred to use the diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Killing_of_Renee_Good#Requested_move_10_January_2026), so I'll use it too.

I use the term illegal immigrant in these notes. I don't necessarily endorse it, but I also don't endorse any of the alternatives. I don't particularly care what short term we use to refer to people who reside in the United States without clear legal permission. I just want us to remember that they're people, they have rights, and after a trial they may very well be found to be legal immigrants who just hadn't completed the relevant paperwork due to their own ignorance or government failures.

When I say "all people," I'm referring to all people under US sovereignty, unless otherwise specified. This includes native-born US citizens, naturalized US citizens, legal residents, legal immigrants, alleged illegal immigrants, immigrants known to be residing here illegally, and tourists. Probably some categories I'm forgetting, too. As long as they're on US soil, they're people under US sovereignty. Unless they're, like, foreign diplomats or their children or something. That's not so relevant here.

## Killing of Renée Good

(list videos here)

### Minutes

All times are local, AM

- Good's wife was on-scene, exchanging angry words with ICE (ICE agent video)
- Protesters were "preventing [ICE] from leaving the scene" - Kristi Noem, Wednesday afternoon news conference
  - Contradicts video evidence showing cars driving away after passing Good's vehicle sideways in the road
- 9:35:05: Good's car stopped diagonally according to Reini-Grandell footage - ABC News
  - When was Good's car was first stopped like this?
  - Four cars pass her on video
  - She waves them on
  - "I'm not mad at you" - Good toward an ICE agent (unclear who) (heard on ICE agent video released by JD Vance)
- 9:36:51: Good's wife and an ICE agent exchange words, record each other - ABC News
- 9:37:13: ICE agent [Jonathan Ross](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/01/08/jonathan-ross-ice-officer-shot-renee-good/88087720007/) fires three shots in 0.7 seconds (0, 0.4, 0.7 seconds since first shot) - ABC News
- 9:37:55: Ross approaches crashed vehicle, yells to "call 911"
  - Did he do this while near the vehicle or afterward?
  - Why didn't he call 911 himself?
  - What, if any, first aid did he administer? If none, why none?
-
- [2026-01-07 7:53 PM - Noem says officer who shot woman was previously hit, dragged by vehicle in June - CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/live-updates/minneapolis-ice-agent-shooting-protesters-clash-fbi-investigation/#post-update-90c4c1ed)
  - Officer was released from hospital within 10 hours
  - She added that the officer, who has yet to be identified, was taken to the hospital after Wednesday's shooting and has since been released
  - > "Our officer followed his training, did exactly what he's been taught to do in that situation and took actions to defend himself and defend his fellow law enforcement officers."

  - Fun fact: minor bruises are a form of internal bleeding
  - Also, we have no evidence this is true. He was admitted to a hospital, standard procedure, and released the same day. Claims from officials are not reliable here--always find hard evidence.
  -

### Hours

- ICE was harassed by protesters all day
  - violent? nonviolent? citations needed
- ICE vehicle stuck in the snow - Kristi Noem and other non-government sources

### Days

- ICE deployed to Minneapolis (when? why, specifically?)

### Months

- Trump admin has drastically escalated ICE operations
- Trump admin has allowed and even endorsed violence
  - Pardoning all January 6th insurrectionists on Day 1

### Years

- Trump himself worked to shut down bipartisan immigration policy during Biden's administration

### Decades

- Everlasting discussions around immigration policy in the United States

## Illegal orders

Can federal agents disobey orders without quitting?

- Yes, when the orders are illegal
  - Whistleblower Act
  - Oath of office
    - All federal agents take an oath to "uphold Constitution against all enemies"
    - An illegal order is an enemy to the Constitution!
- [5 USC 3331: Oath of office](<https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:5%20section:3331%20edition:prelim)>)
  - An individual, except the President, elected or appointed to an office of honor or profit in the civil service or uniformed services, shall take the following oath: “I, AB, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.” This section does not affect other oaths required by law.

  - > while sovereign powers are delegated to the agencies of government, sovereignty itself remains with the people, by whom and for whom all government exists and acts

  - > Among other things, the passenger has the right to refuse to answer any questions about their immigration status, where they were born, or how they entered the US.

## Illegal immigration and crime

This section is specific to illegal immigration, in an effort to determine just how much violence is at stake here.

Also, a quick note: why can't we just catch these violent illegal immigrants the same way we catch other violent people? Just a thought.

## Immigration and the economy

(coming soon)

## Post-hoc accountability

Post-hoc = after the fact. Ideally, stuff like this never happens. No trial will bring back Good. That's to say nothing of those who have died in ICE detainment centers, been deported (and brought back from) CECOT, or endured other assaults, detainments, deportations, harassment, and stress.

## Use of force

- [1791-12-15 - Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution - Library of Congress](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/)
  - > The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

- [2014-05-27 - Plumhoff v. Rickard - Supreme Court via Justia](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/572/765/)
  - > the police officers in this case did not violate the Fourth Amendment when they used deadly force to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase
  - > Rickard’s outrageously reckless driving—which lasted more than five minutes, exceeded 100 miles per hour, and included the passing of more than two dozen other motorists—posed a grave public safety risk
  - > if officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, they need not stop shooting until the threat has ended

  - fleeing felon rule overturned in 1985 Tennessee v. Garner
    - > The [Supreme] Court concluded that the officer’s use of deadly force to prevent the escape of a non-violent felon [Edward Garner] was unconstitutional, writing, “It is not better that all felony suspects die than that they escape.”
  - > In place of the fleeing felon rule, the Court adopted the standard that has remained in place for the last forty years: The Fourth Amendment allows officers to use deadly force, meaning force that is substantially likely to cause serious physical harm or death, in response to what is reasonably perceived as an imminent threat of serious physical harm or death.

  - Includes 3-minute bystander video with audio

  - "I just asked you for an ID that was it" - ICE agent
    - Fourth Amendment protects all people on US soil against unreasonable search and seizure
      - All people have the right to remain silent, though we must explicitly invoke it, see rights of illegal immigrants above. I believe this is Fifth Amendment. This includes refusing to identify yourself or hand over an ID. If this goes against the government's wishes, they can try to get a warrant and then search you. Or they can claim some probable cause if they believe you're likely to do something imminently dangerous based on your behavior. But if their claim is found to be unreasonable, then they've acted illegally and overstepped their power. As a reminder, none of this is legal advice.
  - "You're a fucking US citizen, you shouldn't have done that, you dumbass" - Unclear what the ICE agent is referring to, detained citizen is not resisting and has not resisted
  - "Unlawful arrest," citizen repeats. "We'll see about that," ICE agent replies.
  - "I'm fucking arresting child molesters" says the ICE agent, who is currently detaining a US citizen (we have no reason to believe that citizen is a child molester)
  - Citizen is placed in ICE vehicle
