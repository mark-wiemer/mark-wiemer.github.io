# Luanti

[Luanti](https://docs.luanti.org) (formerly Minetest) has three parts: an open-source "boxel" game engine for making games like Minecraft, a distribution platform for creators, and an application for players. As an open-source project, Luanti games and mods will live for as long as someone has them installed and is willing to share. Usage of Luanti is completely free, and anyone can make copies or modifications to their heart's content, as long as they follow [Luanti's free and open-source license](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

Luanti was started in 2010 and active development continues today! I became a contributor in December 2024 when Luanti contributors started [docs.luanti.org](https://docs.luanti.org). As of February 2025, [I've helped](https://github.com/luanti-org/docs.luanti.org/commits/master/?author=mark-wiemer) migrate content, fix typos, and categorize pages. As the project progresses, I'm sure you'll see me update styles, fix accessibility issues, and really ensure that anyone who wants to learn about Luanti will have their answers clearly presented.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to the Luanti docs! The [source](https://github.com/luanti-org/dev.luanti.org) is hosted on GitHub and build instructions are in the readme :)
