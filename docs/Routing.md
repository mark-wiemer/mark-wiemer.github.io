# Routing

* Route (React Component): wrapper object containing a path and a component. Contains logic for conditional rendering of components based on path.
* Path (string): represents this route's "position" or "name"
* Component (React Component): what is rendered when the user navigates to the path corresponding to this route
* RouteObject (class): used for nesting routes and procedural route generation
