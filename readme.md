# Hello GitHub Pages

A minimal site to deploy to GitHub, changing on a whim, basically UAT for any advanced testing I want to do (e.g. load site on a native mobile device instead of just simulating it via browser devtools)

Repo name `mark-wiemer.github.io` is a magic name for GitHub Pages to work without a custom domain name, keeps it simple when working with `base` logic. Site is deployed at https://mark-wiemer.github.io/
