I'm a math tutor at University of Wisconsin-Madison,\n      and I wanted to create a site to better serve students struggling in math.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This site offers supplemental learning material that I believe is\n      difficult to find elsewhere. Primarily, I focus on abstract\n      problem-solving methods that can be applied to families of problems. With\n      the materials on my site, I aim to help students become unstuck while\n      completing assignments. In this way, I hope to empower students and\n      instill in them confidence in their abilities to tackle large, complex\n      problems.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Everything about this website is open source.
